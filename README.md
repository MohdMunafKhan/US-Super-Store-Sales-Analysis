# US-Super-Store-Sales-Analysis
#Overview
In this project, I am exploring Super Store data using Microsoft Power BI. The main goal is to find interesting things or insights in the data that can help the Super Store owners to make better decisions.
The Super Store dataset is like a big collection of information about what people buy from the store. We're using Microsoft Power BI, a data visulization tool to turn this data into colorful charts and graphs that show us cool stuff about what's happening at the store.
I started by cleaning up the data in the power query editor to make sure it's all correct and organized nicely. Then, using Power BI to create dashboards and reports that show us important and valuable insights and facts like which payment mode is most preferred by customers, from which region most of the customers are coming from, total sales done, how much profit super store made, etc...
